# Anemia-Types-Classification
In the medical field, anemia represents a significant challenge due to its high prevalence and its impact on patients' quality of life. Currently, traditional methods of anemia diagnosis and classification often lack accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the need to improve diagnostic accuracy for more effective treatments. The objective of this study was to develop an anemia type classification system by using artificial intelligence machine learning models, applying Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) methodology. Data were obtained from the Kaggle platform from the “Anemia Types Classification” dataset by author Ehab Aboelnaga, which contains 1281 complete blood count records. Extensive preprocessing was performed including detection and removal of duplicate records, as well as outliers. Three classification models were used: Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors and XGBoost. The evaluation of the models was carried out using cross-validation, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity metrics. The results showed that the Decision Tree Classifier model was the most accurate, achieving 100 percent prediction accuracy. This finding highlights the feasibility of integrating advanced data analysis techniques into clinical diagnosis, suggesting that the adoption of these models can optimize the diagnostic process.
